Exploring acoustic diversity via soundscape_IR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**soundscape_IR** is a python-based toolbox of soundscape information retrieval, aiming to assist in the analysis of soundscape recordings. The toolbox is primarily designed for: (1) visualization of soundscape dynamics and (2) audio source separation. Workflows provided by **soundscape_IR** open new directions to assess acoustic diversity in diverse environments and to acoustically quantify ecological interactions across individual, species, and ecosystem levels.
